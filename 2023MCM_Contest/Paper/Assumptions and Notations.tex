\section{Assumptions and Notations}
\subsection{Assumptions}
$\bullet$ Assume that the results reported from each player were independent to each other, and the trial times distributions for each player were roughly the same.

$\bullet$ Assume that the trial times larger than 7 can be treated as 7 times for simplification of our model because whether exactly 7 times or more won't affect our model much.
